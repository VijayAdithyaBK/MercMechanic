Overview of the Braking System
The vehicle is equipped with a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system.
If the ABS light is on, it indicates a malfunction in the Anti-Lock Braking System.
Common causes for ABS warning include a blown fuse, a defective wheel speed sensor, or the generic ABS control module failure.

Fuses and Relays
The fuse box is located in the engine compartment on the driver's side.
Fuse #42 protects the ABS Control Module.
Fuse #10 basic radio functionality.
Relay R3 controls the starter motor.

Engine Troubleshooting
If the engine vibrates excessively, check the engine mounts and spark plugs.
A misfire in Cylinder 1 can be caused by a faulty coil pack or spark plug.
Use only approved engine oil MB-Approval 229.5.

Battery Information
The 12V battery is located in the trunk under the floor panel.
If the red battery icon appears, the alternator may not be charging the battery.
Ensure battery terminals are clean and tight.

Brake System Maintenance
The brake pads are equipped with electrical wear sensors.
When the pads reach their wear limit, a message appears on the Instrument Cluster.
Squeaking noises during braking often indicate that the pads are worn down or dirty.
For the Mercedes E-Class, use only OEM Brake Pads Part# A-000-420-1234.

Tire and Wheel Care
Vibration steering wheel at high speeds (above 80 km/h) often points to unbalanced tires or poor wheel alignment.
Check tire pressures monthly. Recommended pressure is listed on the fuel filler flap.
